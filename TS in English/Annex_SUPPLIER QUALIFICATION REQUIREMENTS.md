<p>QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPLIERS AND REQUIRED QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM STANDARDS</p>
<ol>
<li>Qualification of the supplier shall comply with the qualification requirements set out in this Annex. If the supplier&rsquo;s qualification for the right to engage in the related activity has not been or is not fully verified, the Supplier shall undertake to the contracting authority that the contract will be performed only by the persons who have the right to engage in the related activity.</li>
<li>If a tender is submitted on the basis of a joint activity agreement of a group of economic operators, at least one member of the group of economic operators or all members of the group of economic operators shall jointly meet the requirements set out in this Annex and submit the specified documents.</li>
<li>Where the supplier relies on the capacity of other economic operators to meet the established economic and financial capacity requirements, they shall be jointly and severally liable for performance of the contract. In such case, the tender shall be accompanied by a copy of the guarantee contract signed by the economic operator certifying that the economic operator, whose economic and (or) financial capacity is relied on, is jointly and severally liable for the contractual obligations of the supplier and will indemnify for any damage incurred as the result of improper fulfilment and (or) non-fulfilment of obligations. The supplier, which will be recognized as the successful tenderer, will be obliged to submit the originals of the signed guarantee agreement, and failure to submit them shall be deemed that the supplier has refused to sign the contract under the conditions specified in the procurement documents.</li>
<li>The contracting authority may consider that the supplier does not have the required professional capacity if it identifies a conflict of interests which could adversely affect the performance of the contract.</li>
<li>The following requirements are established for the qualification of the supplier:</li>
