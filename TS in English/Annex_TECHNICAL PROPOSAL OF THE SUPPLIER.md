<li><strong>Risk management </strong><em><u>(this information may be indicated as confidential by the supplier)</u></em>
<ul>
<li>The highest and, in the opinion of the Office, essential risk of the SAULĖ IS project is not to implement the project to the intended extent within the specified term and by 2023 not to validate the IS. In this case, the whole project becomes ineligible for funding, considering the rules set for the 2014-2020 funding period. Accordingly, the supplier must indicate the solutions it proposes to manage these risks.</li>
<li>The supplier provides 5 key solutions for managing the risks specified in item 4.4.1 of this Annex:</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Project implementation solutions </strong><em>(<u>this information may not be indicated as confidential by the supplier</u>)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The supplier shall provide information on the technical aspects of the Project implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>If SAULĖ IS will be created using an already created, data-based system, the supplier must provide information on the system, provide information on copyright. The supplier must also indicate which technological solutions will be used in adapting (modifying) the proposed system so that it fully complies with the requirements of the Technical Specification;</li>
<li>If SAULĖ IS will be created according to the Technical Specification without using an already created operating system, the supplier must provide information on which technological solutions will be used;</li>
<li>SAULĖ IS is planned to be implemented on the basis of the principles based on the architecture of micro-services, therefore, considering the above, the supplier must specify:
<ul>
<li>for which SAULĖ IS components provided in architectural diagram on fig. 7.2 of the Technical Specification the principle of micro-service architecture or equivalent architecture, or mixed architecture would apply. A description with diagrams shall be provided;</li>
<li>what principles will be applied for decomposing the components presented in the functional diagram of the internal portal provided in fig. 7.3 of the Technical specification into smaller program applications. A description with diagrams shall be provided, with at least two items selected from each figure;</li>
<li>how the functions of the smaller program applications referred to in point 4.5.3.2 will be divided into several independent tasks or several independent services (smaller sets of models) on the basis of which the application applications they will operate. The program application must be broken down in such detail that it is possible to determine that any change or failure in the smaller model sets will affect only one independent task or independent service, but will not affect the operation of the entire feature and / or application. A description with diagrams shall be provided, with at least two items selected from each figure.</li>
</ul>
