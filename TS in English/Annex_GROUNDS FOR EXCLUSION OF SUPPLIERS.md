<p>GROUNDS FOR EXCLUSION OF SUPPLIERS</p>
<ol>
<li>The supplier (also, each member of a group of suppliers individually, if the tender is submitted by a group of suppliers) and if the supplier relies on capacities of economic operators according to Article 49 of the LPP - each supplier must meet the requirements set out in this Annex for the absence of grounds for exclusion.</li>
<li>The contracting authority shall exclude a supplier from participation in the procurement procedure at any stage where it turns out that it conforms, in view of acts committed or omitted either before or during the procedure, to at least one of the supplier&rsquo;s exclusion grounds specified in this Annex to the Procurement Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li>If the situation of an economic operator, whose capacity is relied on by the supplier in accordance with Article 49 of the LPP, meets at least one of the established grounds for exclusion, the contracting authority shall require the supplier to replace that economic operator with an eligible subcontractor within a term set by the contracting authority.</li>
<li>The contracting authority may not apply the grounds for exclusion from the procurement procedure set out in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of Article 46 of the LPP only in exceptional cases where it is necessary to ensure the protection of the public interest, including public health and the environment.</li>
<li>If a supplier (including economic operators, whose capacities the supplier relies on, and subcontractors (if any)) does not meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 4 and 6 of Article 46 of the LPP, the contracting authority shall not exclude it from participation in a procurement procedure where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
<ul>
<li>The supplier has provided to the contracting authority evidence to the effect that it has taken the following measures:
<ul>
<li>Has voluntarily paid or undertaken to pay compensation in respect of any damage caused by the criminal act or misconduct referred to in paragraph 1 or 4 of Article 46 of the LPP, where applicable;</li>
<li>Has collaborated, actively assisted or taken other measures with a view to investigating, detecting the criminal act or misconduct committed by it, where applicable;</li>
<li>Has taken technical, organisational and personnel measures that are appropriate to prevent further criminal acts or misconduct;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The contracting authority has evaluated the information provided by the supplier in accordance with point 1 of this Annex and has taken a reasoned decision that the measures taken by the economic operator are sufficient to demonstrate its reliability. The sufficiency of these measures shall be evaluated taking into account the gravity and particular circumstances of a criminal act or misconduct. The contracting authority must submit to the supplier the reasoned decision in writing not later than within 10 days from the receipt of the economic operator&rsquo;s information referred to in point 5.1 of this Annex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each subcontractor must meet the requirements set out in points 8-11 for the absence of grounds for exclusion. If the situation of the subcontractor meets at least one of the specified grounds for exclusion, the contracting authority shall require the supplier to replace the mentioned subcontractor with the subcontractor which meets the requirements within the time limit set by the contracting authority.</li>
<li>Each natural person (specialist) whose qualifications the supplier relies on and who, in the event of a successful award, the supplier intends to employ, must meet the requirements set out in points 8-10 for the absence of grounds for exclusion. If the situation of such a natural person meets at least one of the established grounds for exclusion, the contracting authority shall require the supplier to replace that natural person with the natural person or economic operator who/which meets the requirements within the time limit set by the contracting authority.</li>

<p>In the event of a breach of the obligations relating to the payment of taxes, including social security contributions, in accordance with the legal provisions of the country in which the supplier is established or of the country of the contracting authority, the supplier shall be excluded from participation in a procurement procedure if the contracting authority becomes aware that the supplier has been convicted on this ground, as defined in points 1 and 3 of paragraph 2 of Article 46 or has other evidence of the breach of these obligations.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A supplier or its responsible person shall be deemed to have been convicted of afore-mentioned criminal acts, where:</p>
