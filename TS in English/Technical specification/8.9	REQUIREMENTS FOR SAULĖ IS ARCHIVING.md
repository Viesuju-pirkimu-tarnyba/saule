## 8.9	REQUIREMENTS FOR SAULĖ IS ARCHIVING

2507. SAULĖ IS must have functions that enable logical archiving of data processed by SAULĖ IS. When implementing logical data archiving tools, the data object (record, related records, file or other object) must be assigned an archive attribute, leaving SAULĖ IS functional modules with the same level of access as the unarchived data. The operational logic of SAULĖ IS functional modules must include rules for how to handle logically archived data (for example, when searching for digital content, by default, search only those SAULĖ IS data that are not marked as transferred to the SAULĖ IS logical archive, but SAULĖ IS user leave the possibility to enable search in the interface also between logically archived data - this is necessary for optimizing the speed of operation of SAULĖ IS search functions and other functions).
2508. At the detailed analysis design phase, the rules for the data to be archived (frequency, scope, etc.) must be defined.
