Problems of the current situation:
The National Anti-Corruption Program of the Republic of Lithuania for 2015-2025, approved by Resolution No XII-1537 of the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania of 10 March 2015 “On the Approval of the National Anti-Corruption Program of the Republic of Lithuania for 2015–2025” (hereinafter referred to as the Program) identifies 8 priority areas where the possibility of the spread of corruption is the highest. One of these areas is public procurement.
Reasons for high levels of corruption in public procurement: 
•	Significant impact of public procurement on the country`s economy and business entities,
•	Insufficiently effective control mechanism, 
•	Insufficient liability for offences committed, 
•	Influence of politicians, etc. 

In specific cases, corruption is still affected by informal preliminary agreements, adaption of qualification requirements for protected companies, procurement of unnecessary goods, services or additional works, improper performance and supervision of contracts, abuse of rights of suppliers to defend their interests, insufficient competition of social enterprises, unlawful agreements between such enterprises and abuse of social enterprise status, competition restrictive (cartel) agreements. Suppliers participating in public procurement enter into unlawful agreements, and it is difficult to exclude such suppliers from public procurement under the current legal framework.

**The main problem to be solved** is the insufficiently automated public procurement system, which creates conditions for various manifestations of corruption. The development of electronic management is one of the tools for transparency, openness and citizen involvement in management and democratic processes.
Considering the problems listed above and in accordance with the legal acts, it is planned to computerise the following activities by CPP IS modification:

•	Integrate the system with the systems of other institutions which data are relevant in the public procurement procedure and control institutions - this would allow to refuse to receive paper documents from the competent authorities, prevent forgery of documents.
•	Automate the procurement process from the planning of the procurement to the conclusion of the contract, so that there would be minimum human factors and to avoid providing incorrect information or forgery of documents.
•	Develop tools for greater publicity. Publicity is a key tool in the fight against corruption; 
•	Develop tools for low-value procurement in order to ensure fair and convenient selection of suppliers, especially in case of unpublished procurement. Low-value procurement accounts for a significant proportion of public procurement and must be provided with convenient and anti-abuse tools;
•	Create interfaces with systems or functionalities to trace potential conflicts of interest;
•	Prevent corruption schemes in public procurement contracts - one of the possibilities for corruption in public procurement is to set contract terms when one of the suppliers is not ready to perform them, therefore stricter contract supervision and measures in the system are needed. It is provided that the contract will be electronic, filled in the system, and will also include amendments to the contract, which would allow more accurate and urgent identification of breaches of the contract performance;
•	Automate the procedure for issuing certificates of successful contracts;
•	Develop automatic tools for exclusion of suppliers included to "blacklists" from the procurement procedure;
•	Implement other measures to prevent acts of corruption.
Details of current CPP IS operational processes are provided is Section 10.2. Column 5 of the table indicates in which environment and by what means the process is currently performed.
Future CPP IS operational processes are provided is Section 10.3. Column 5 of the table indicates which processes and upgrades of CPP IS will be carried out with the help of CPP IS tools.
