## 8.2	REQUIREMENTS FOR SAULĖ IS ARCHITECTURE

##### 8.2.1	Requirements for high availability 

<ol>
<li>The architectural solution must ensure high availability of SAULĖ IS, which can be realized with the help of virtualization software functionality, pool orchestration software functionality, operating system functionality, hardware capabilities or other software. High availability must be realized at the service layer, integration layer and data layer.
<ul>
<li>The installation of all installed components and their management components must ensure their high availability. High availability solutions must be based on the software manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations (referring to the manufacturer&rsquo;s published installation (high reliability) recommendations).</li>
<li>High availability solutions must operate automatically (in case of incidents). Human involvement may only be required to restore the operation of the SAULĖ IS to the state it was in before the incident.</li>
<li>The high availability solution must be described in the design document and approved by the PPO.</li>
<li>Data nodes on the large data platform must be at least tripled. Name nodes must be installed according to the software manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations to ensure their high availability.</li>
<li>Load balancers must be used to ensure high availability and flow balancing, which can be implemented as software or using specialized appliances provided by the data centre).</li>
<li>The high availability solution must provide RPO (Recovery point objective) - 15 minutes, RTO (Recovery time objective) - 1 hour. (when this or a better level of service is provided by the data centre infrastructure).</li>
<li>The SAULĖ IS solution designed by the installer must ensure that the availability of SAULĖ IS is at least 96% of the time around the clock, as long as the SAULĖ IS infrastructure does not limit it (when such or better level of service provision is ensured by the data centre infrastructure).</li>
<li>SAULĖ IS must be designed with the ability to be restored or operated in a backup data centre (Disaster Recovery) to pre-prepared equipment (warm recovery). The necessary licenses must be provided for this purpose, if required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

#### 8.2.2	Requirements for scalability 

2405. The architecture must support the development capabilities of SAULĖ IS by connecting additional hardware or virtual infrastructure;
2406. Architecture must be designed on the basis of multi-tier architecture, creating opportunities for its development at the levels of individual layers;
2407. Possibilities for system development must be created to supplement the system with new computing or storage resources without performing additional system redesign or implementation works. Capacity building must be performed without interrupting system operation.

#### 8.2.3	Requirements for backing up, restoring, and monitoring the system

2408. The installer shall assess the services provided by VDPT and define and implement backup copying processes, tools and rules. SAULĖ IS must allow data to be restored from backup data. The installer must define and implement copy recovery processes, tools, and rules. The Installer must implement the backup and restore processes with the backup and restore software provided by the VPN (temporarily, until the use of VDPT services, which will have to ensure the backup and restore software, the Contracting Authority will provide backup and restore software during the transition period).
2409. Solutions for monitoring the operation and early warning of the system and its components must be implemented. Users with system administrator rights must be able to monitor the performance of the system and its individual components (active users, memory usage, CPU load and other important indicators) by web means and receive notifications when components fail or perform when critical values are reached.

#### Requirements for micro-service architecture

<ol>
<li>SAULĖ IS must be designed and implemented in accordance with the principles of micro-service architecture:
<ul>
<li>SAULĖ IS must be decomposed into logical, rational, self-acting software units (micro-services) that would communicate with other SAULĖ IS micro-services on the principles of RESTful or equivalent technologies;</li>
<li>Micro-services must implement their own data structures (directly used only by the micro-services themselves) (exceptions apply to analysis software, artificial intelligence software, etc.).</li>
<li>A software must be used to ensure automatic scaling of the micro-service when the specified limit loads of the micro-service are reached. The overall SAULĖ IS solution must allow (unrestricted) micro-service auto-start functionality.</li>
<li>The service registry, service discovery service must be used.</li>
<li>Message queue management or equivalent software must be used for communication between micro-services.</li>
<li>The installation, operation and deactivation of micro-services must be independent of the operation or non-operation of other micro-services.</li>
<li>Other necessary principles of realization of micro-service architecture must be used, based on the recommendations of the software manufacturers used for the realization of SAULĖ IS architecture.</li>
<li>Installation of new versions of SAULĖ IS must not require stopping (restarting) SAULĖ IS.</li>
<li>Automated testing and implementation of SAULĖ IS components (Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI / CD)) must be implemented. Automatic test execution and test data generation must be implemented. The installer must implement automatic tests and automatic generation of test data according to the volumes agreed at the design stage, which would ensure the widest possible automated testing of SAULĖ IS functionality.</li>
<li>Measures and implemented solutions must be provided to ensure the compatibility of the versions of SAULĖ IS being developed, tested and implemented.</li>
<li>Measures must be provided and solutions implemented to ensure change management of micro-services.</li>
<li>Other solutions based on good practices necessary to ensure the architecture of micro-services must be used. The solutions proposed by the Installer must be approved at the Contracting Authority&rsquo;s analysis and design phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation of monolithic applications should be avoided - software that implements different business tasks and independent use cases in one (or only several) applications (one (or several) compiled software source code files are installed on one application server).</li>
</ol>

#### 8.2.5	Requirements for multi-tier architecture 

<ol>
<li>SAULĖ IS architecture must be multi-tier (N-tier), it must consist of at least 4 hierarchical levels (representation, activity logic, database, integrations). Multi-tier architecture must be combined with microservice architecture in order to achieve the most rational implementation of SAULĖ IS architecture.
<ul>
<li>The Presentation Layer must provide a set of computer tools for accessing the digital content provided by SAULĖ IS through possible digital channels and at the same time to the SAULĖ IS user interfaces required for the performance of SAULĖ IS functions. The visualization level must interact with the application layer through systematic messages.</li>
<li>The application layer must fully or partially automate the steps of the business processes or a part of them and control the course of the execution of the software functions. At the application layer, systematic messages must be received, processed and transmitted to the presentation layer. This layer must also serve: (a) the data layer, by making appropriate data requests, processing the received data, transmitting it for storage or modifying it; (b) the presentation layer by transmitting to it data received from the data layer and / or processed at the application layer and receiving and transmitting other system instructions.</li>
<li>The Database Layer must be implemented in the form of an operating system file system, databases, data caches, or repositories. At the database layer, different data sets must be integrated into a single, unified data exchange platform using components at the application layer.</li>
<li>The Integration Layer must ensure the exchange of the necessary data both between the internal components of SAULĖ IS and with external information systems. Data exchange is ensured by implemented WS or RESTful integration interfaces and / or direct access to the DB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

####  8.2.6	Requirements for data model

<ol>
<li>SAULĖ IS data model must be developed using OCDS (The Open Contracting Data Standard) standard data model (https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/):
<ul>
<li>All SAULĖ IS data specified in the technical specification must be implemented in a data model corresponding to the OCDS data model;</li>
<li>The installer must implement all data entities (along with attributes and interfaces) according to the OCDS data model that are necessary to create the functions named in the specification</li>

</li>
<li>The Supplier shall implement the SAULĖ IS functions (in addition to those described in the specification) that are necessary to process the data (data entities and their attributes) that will be implemented in the system based on OCDS or other standards.</li>
<li>The data must be processed in accordance with the OCDS standard and must be applied to those SAULĖ IS processes that are required for the common European contract register planned to be created. More information on the planned European Procurement Register can be found at this link <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/2020/01/23/open-contracting-the-eu-in-2020-what-to-expect/">https://www.open-contracting.org/2020/01/23/open-contracting-the-eu-in-2020-what-to-expect/</a>.</li>
<li>SAULĖ IS must be accumulate all data objects in all e-Forms standard described in Regulations (EU) 2019/1780 of the Commission of 23 September 2019, unless the PPO expresses the need to abandon the collection of certain data in SAULĖ IS. During the detailed analysis and design phase, the association of the data objects described in the e-Forms standard with the data objects collected by SAULĖ IS will have to be provided.</li>
<li>When designing the implementation of SAULĖ IS, the list of structured and publicly available data to be provided to the PPO will have to be constantly updated and coordinated.</li>
<li>Data processed by SAULĖ IS must be entered once and automatically linked or re-used where applicable.</li>
<li>The diagram below shows the basic structure and interrelationships of data objects related to procurement. The schema should not be seen as detailed model of SAULĖ IS data. Also, for easier reading of the chart, it does not exclude objects that can be several of the same type in one procurement.</li>
<li>The publicity of the objects in the diagram is indicative and does not reflect the partial (incomplete) disclosure of data described in detail in Section 7.5 &ldquo;General Requirements&rdquo; (providing confidential data disclosure requirements (detailed in other chapters, for example, describing publicity of contracts in Section 7.6.9 &ldquo;Requirements for Subsystem of Contracts&rdquo;) or arising from operating restrictions (for example, due to non-display of the name of specific suppliers when reporting the results of the opening of the price envelopes described in Section 7.6.5 &ldquo;Requirements for the Tender Assessment Subsystem&rdquo;).</li>
