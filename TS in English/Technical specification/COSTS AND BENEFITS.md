## 7.2 USE AND MAINTENANCE COSTS  
Up to 15 per cent of the information system development value is planned to be allocated for the maintenance of CPP IS, regular updating of technical means and licenses. The cost of human resources is not estimated, as the System will be used and serviced by the existing number of the PPO employees.

## 7.3 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS
The project is considered non-revenue generating as no third-party revenue is expected to be generated.
The impact components affecting the social and economic benefits of the Project were identified and selected on the basis of the Public Institution Central Project Management Agency Conversion Factors and Economic and Social Benefit (Harm) Calculation Methodology and its Annex 6 “Conversion Factors and Values of Social and Economic Benefit (Harm) Component Estimates”. The components of the social and economic benefit impact have been identified:
•	Better performance of the information system; 
•	Time and money savings.

**Indicators calculated according to the impact component “Better performance of the information system”** - In 2015 the PPO paid great attention to monitoring of implementation of procurement contracts, monitoring of negative trends. Procurement contract were executed without following the conditions set out in therein. In 2015 after checking of 80 procurement contracts with a total value of 306.6 million euros and it makes up 7.4 per cent of the value of all procurement contract concluded in 2015, even 91 per cent of audited procurement contracts contained violations of their execution. The estimated value of procurement contracts in which violations have been detected is EUR 276 512 168.56, the value of procurement contracts where no violations have been detected is EUR 30 047 990.91.
Information technology for information exchange can help to prevent these procurement cases and detect these activities or errors.


**Indicators calculated according to the impact component “Time and money savings”** - only the number of procurements announced is considered, as it is the type of procurement that is most similar and can be averaged over the duration of the procedures. In 2015 the number of procurements announced (open tenders, simplified open tenders) was 9605 pcs. The specialist of the Contracting Authority spent on average about 20 hours preparing the procurement terms and conditions, filling in the procurement notice, answering the inquiries and claims of the suppliers before the implementation of the project. It took an average of about 28 hours to evaluate the tenders and make decisions about the successful tenderer. Considering the number of procurements, 461 040.00 hours were wasted in 2015. After the analysis, it was determined that after the implementation of the project, the specialist will perform all the listed procedures within 22 hours, for a total of 211 310.00 hours. Assessing the volume of procurements in 2015, this will save 249 730.00 hours.

The average time spent by the contracting authority with CPP IS v.1 and CPP IS v.2 is provided in Table 8.


Public procurement process step | Average time spent with CPP IS v. 1 | CPP IS v. 1 and CPP IS v. 2 (auxiliary software) prototype of some    functionalities
-- | -- | --
Preparation of procurement conditions, draft   procurement contract and technical specification | 12 h | 5 h
Notice completion | 2 h | 0.1 h
Answers to inquiries of suppliers | 6 h | 6 h
Tender assessment (administrative,   qualification, technical, arithmetical error checking, abnormally low price   determination stages) and procurement reports | 24 h | 6.9 h
Responses to claims of suppliers | 4 h | 4 h

Representatives of the suppliers spent on average about 24 hours for the preparation of the tender, and 8 hours for answering to the contracting authority`s inquiries during the assessment. Considering the volume of procurements in 2015, it took 307 360.00 hours. After evaluating the CPP IS 2.0 optimized processes, suppliers will spend about 16 hours, and the volume of procurements in 2015 will amount to 153 680.00 hours. 153,680.00 hours are saved. For the purpose of calculating the social benefits of a project, each procurement is considered to receive one tender.

The average time spent by the suppliers with CPP IS v.1 and CPP IS v.2 is provided in Table 9.

Table 9. Comparison of time spent by representatives of suppliers for tender preparation process

Public procurement   process step | Average time spent   with CPP IS v. 1 | Average time spent   with CPP IS v. 2
-- | -- | --
Preparation of the tender - in order not to artificially increase the   social benefits created by the Project, it will be considered that 1.0   supplier participated in each procurement | 24 h | 10 h
Response to inquiries | 8 h | 6 h

After the implementation of the Project, extremely high social and economic benefits will be achieved, which, depending on the chosen alternative, is 1.3-5.8 times higher than the costs. A positive EGDV demonstrates that the investment will repay through economic and social benefits, the economic benefits of the Project will cover the amount of funds invested. Several times higher than 5 per cent EVGN shows that the economic benefits generated by the Project justify the return and value of the Project implementation, therefore it is recommended to implement the Project.
