## CREATION PROJECT MANAGEMENT

### 9.1 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE

Organisational structure of project management consists of two levels:  

•	Project Administration Group (hereinafter referred to as PAG),

•	Project Implementation Group (hereinafter referred to as PIG). 

All members participating in the Project Groups are called members of the Project Implementation Group. 
The PPO has qualified and experienced employees to deal with organisational, economic and financial, technological issues related to the implementation of the Project. PAG consisting of 4 employees will be formed to manage the Project.

The Project will be implemented, and the quality of service provided by service providers will be ensured by 11 PPO employees responsible for different areas, who will be members of the PIG. Members of this Group may be invited to attend meetings of the PAG or the Project Supervision Group and participate in other related activities.
The roles of the Project organisational structure units during the Project implementation are summarized in Table 10.

The decision on the Project implementation procedure and appointment of responsible persons, approved by Order No 1S-66 (1.2 E) of the Director of the Public Procurement Office of 2 June 2020 “On the Amendment of Order No 1S-41 of the Director of the Public Procurement Office of 10 March 2017 “On the Approval of Formation of the Team for Implementation of the Project” Modification of the Central Public Procurement Information System ”and Functions of its Members”.

## 9.2 SELECTED CREATION METHOD

The following volume factors were considered in selecting the appropriate method for the creation and implementation of CPP IS:
•	acquisition and adaptation of specialised software;
•	creation of individual components (programming);
•	testing;
•	implementation, data migration, integration;
•	trial operation;
•	documentation (preparation of user manuals, etc.);
•	user training.

Project activities will be carried out in stages and will consist of the preparation and execution of procurement and the implementation of contracts with suppliers. The new information system will be developed using the Agile principle. Using the Agile project management method, product development is organised in the shortest possible cycles. Receiving the first running version of the product in few weeks after the start of the project gives a clearer understanding of the size of the project, potential risks, and feedback.

## 9.3 SOURCES OF FINANCING AND FINANCING PROCEDURE

It is planned to receive the necessary financing for the implementation of the Project from the EU structural support and the state budget of the Republic of Lithuania: in order to implement the Project, the Project application will be submitted in accordance with Priority 10 of the European Union Funds Investment Operational Program for 2014–2020 “Public Needs and Smart Public Administration”, instrument No 10.1.2-ESFA-V-916 “Implementation of National Anti-Corruption Measures”. The planned part of financing from this source is 100%, own contribution of the PPO to the project implementation is not expected.

## 9.4 WORK SCHEDULES
CPP IS modification duration – 24 months.
The Project will be implemented in an iterative-incremental way of information system development, applying good “Agile” software development practices.
The Project will be implemented by creating six increments (iterations):
•	The first increment must include the initialization, detailed analysis, design, development, installation in the test environment, and acceptance testing stages (requirements for the stages are provided in the table below).
•	The second, third, fourth, and fifth increments must include the stages of detailed analysis, design, development, installation in the test environment, and acceptance testing (requirements for the stages are provided in the table below). Upon the separate instruction of the Contracting Authority, these increments may include pilot operation and installation in a production environment, where it is agreed during the execution of the Project that a part of the functionality must be installed in production.
•	The sixth increment must cover all stages (except initiation) (the requirements for the stages are provided in the table below).
During the implementation of increments, the Installer must make all changes (modification) of the functionalities created during the previous increments, if such a need becomes clear during the detailed analysis and design stage.
Duration of the stages, stages, works, responsible parties and results are described in Table 11.

## 9.5 ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH PERFORMANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (TESTING)

The following tests must be performed during CPP IS testing:
•	Internal testing. Internal testing of individual components must be performed by the Installer without the participation of PPO representatives, but must provide evidence of such testing - an internal testing report and a list of identified non-compliances;
•	Safety testing;
•	Load (speed) testing;
•	Acceptance testing. This testing should only be performed after positive safety and load testing results have been obtained with the participation of the Executor, the PPO and other interested parties. During this testing, the implementation of the testing objectives (determination of the level of implementation) must be checked. Acceptance testing activities must be conducted in accordance with a defined acceptance testing plan and methodology.

The testing performed must ensure that the upgraded CPP IS is suitable for trial operation.
During acceptance testing, the identified errors, problems and deficiencies must be recorded. The Installer is responsible for registration. 
The error log – there must be specialized issue tracking and tracking software based on network technologies, i.e. accessible via a web browser.
The Installer will need to prepare all the test data required for testing.
The Installer will need to ensure that there is sufficient test data in the CPP IS during acceptance testing to fully test the functionality of the upgraded CPP IS.
Acceptance testing will be completed when the test acceptance criteria specified in the testing plan and methodology is met.

## 9.6 INSTALLATION AND ASSESSMENT OF SUITABILITY FOR USE

The Installer shall create test and operational environments in the State Cloud Service Provider environment specified by PPO, selected data centre of service provider, or PPO technical infrastructure and install all necessary software for CPP IS testing and CPP IS operation, respectively.
The implementation of CPP IS is performed in as follows:
•	The Installer must create test and operational environments where the PPO provides the technical and organisational conditions for this.
•	The Installer`s upgraded CPP IS operating environment must ensure high availability and security.
•	The Installer must install measures to ensure the automatic installation of new versions of the system in the operating environment, ensuring its operation during installation.
•	Solutions must be implemented so that software code, applications, databases can be updated in the required environments without additional user actions.
•	The Installer must provide consultations to PPO employees on all issues related to the implementation of the CPP IS software.

CPP IS acceptance is performed as follows:
•	The final acceptance of CPP IS will take place at the end of the trial operation, i.e. acceptance will only be possible once the acceptance criteria for trial operation have been met.
•	CPP IS will be accepted by signing the Handover Certificate.
•	Without prejudice to the intellectual property rights of the copyright holder or third parties, the Installer shall contractually transfer the PPO copyright to custom software and design documents, including, but not limited to, the right to use the software for an indefinite period and at no additional charge; the right to make copies of the created software; the right to modify and further develop the developed software; the right to transfer the software to another technological platform; the right to use and modify the source code of the software created for it (machine language source texts);
