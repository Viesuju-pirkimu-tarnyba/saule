## 8	NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

#### 8.1	IMPLEMENTATION OF REQUIREMENTS

<ol>
<li>The installer must implement all the requirements of the specification.</li>
<li>The terms &ldquo;must / have / operate / ensure / allow / comply&rdquo;, &ldquo;must be able&rdquo;, &ldquo;must be possible&rdquo; used in this document are equivalent and mean that the Installer must create and install (or provide and install) the appropriate functionality and provide appropriate services. Functionality that is specified in the future (&ldquo;will&rdquo;, &ldquo;enable&rdquo;, &ldquo;will include&rdquo;) indicates the state to be implemented and means that the Installer must create and install (or provide and install) the appropriate functionality.</li>
<li>The installer or PPO may propose an alternative way of implementing a separate specification requirement or exchanging the implementation of the requirement for equivalent functionality, which would not in any way adversely affect the project goal, objectives and final results and would not contradict the requirements of procurement legislation. Each proposed alternative or requirement-changing functionality must be compatible with the PPO and the approval of the requirement change and revision protocol. In the event of a change to a requirement for equivalent functionality, the Installer will be required to provide a written justification, including a description of the impact and criticality of the change, justifying that the change does not affect the full functionality of SAULĖ IS.</li>
<li>The installer may offer alternative architectural implementation methods that would ensure equivalent or better SAULĖ IS speed, high availability, scalability, interoperability, support, security and convenience. Each proposal must be assessed and approved by the PPO.</li>
