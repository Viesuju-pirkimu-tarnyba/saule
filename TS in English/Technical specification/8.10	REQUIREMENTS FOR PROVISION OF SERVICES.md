The Installer will have to consider the results of the tests and trials performed by the representatives of the Contracting Authority, to eliminate all bugs (violations, recommendations) indicated in the results of the tests. The Installer will have to create the necessary conditions for the planned tests and trials - provide source code, provide login data to SAULĖ IS components, create users required for testing, enable / disable SAULĖ IS components, provide access to specialized testing and testing software, perform other necessary activities, which would ensure the full implementation of the testing and trial process.</p>

#### 8.10.4	Requirements for installation

2533. Below one can find a basic diagram of SAULĖ IS installation. The distribution of software installation between virtual machines and pools presented in the diagram is of an illustrative nature and must be adjusted at the design stage, defining and justifying the distribution of installation in each case.

Testing - used throughout the operation period of the SAULĖ IS. The architectural solutions of the test environment must be based on the solutions of the production environment. The number of components installed in the test environment may be reduced (and / or grouped) in order to use resources rationally, such solutions must be approved by the Contracting Authority. There are no high availability requirements for the test environment. There are no data backup requirements for the test environment. The speed of the test environment must ensure that the average SAULĖ IS response time (time from receiving the HTTP request from the server to sending the HTTP response) does not exceed 3 seconds for a total 60 HTTP requests per minute.<br />2534.3.

The scope of installation will have to be agreed at the design stage. There are no high accessibility requirements for the training environment. There are no data backup requirements for the training environment. The speed of the training environment must ensure that the average SAULĖ IS response time (time from receiving the HTTP request from the server to sending the HTTP response) does not exceed 3 seconds, with a total of 150 HTTP requests per minute when up to 50 users are working in the system at the same time.<br />2534.4. Sand box environment - used throughout the operation period of SAULĖ IS. The sand box environment is intended for PPO specialists who, individually or with the help of the Installer, will perform tests, trials, experiments (change configuration parameters, installation parameters, install another (additional) software), etc. The sand box environment will have to be implemented according to the architectural principles of the production environment. The number of components installed in the sand box environment may be reduced (and / or grouped) in order to rational use of resources, such decisions must be approved by the Contracting Authority. High availability solutions must be implemented in the sand box for testing and configuration purposes. The components of the sand box environment, the scope of installation, the configuration parameters and the solutions used must be changed at the request of the Contracting Authority.
