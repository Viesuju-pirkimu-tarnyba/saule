The Service Recipient has the right to reject the implementation (performance) security of the Agreement upon receipt of information that the legal entity securing the implementation (performance) of the Agreement has become insolvent or has not fulfilled its obligations to other economic operators or has improperly performed them. The performance security is intended to ensure the fulfilment of all contractual obligations of the Service Provider and the indemnification of losses incurred as the result of improper performance or non-performance of the obligations assumed by the Service Provider under the Agreement, including payment of interest and penalties.</li>

<li>The Agreement implementation (performance) security must be provided in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex No. 5 to the Agreement &ldquo;Requirements for Guarantees and Letters of Comfort&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Agreement implementation (performance) security and all accompanying documents (originals) shall be returned at the request of the Service Provider upon its expiry or upon proper performance of contractual obligations assumed by the Service provider under the Agreement (whichever is earlier).</li>

In order to continue to fulfil the obligations under the Agreement, the Service Provider must submit a new security for the fulfilment (performance) of the terms and conditions of the Agreement to the Service Recipient within 5 (five) business days for an amount not less than the amount specified in the Agreement. Subsequent amendments or supplements to the Agreement or other related documents will not affect the performance or scope of the obligations of the legal entity securing the performance of the Agreement under the terms and conditions of the Agreement and will not release the legal entity securing the performance of the Agreement from full performance of the assumed obligations.</li>
<li>If the Service Provider commits a material breach of the Agreement and the Service Recipient unilaterally terminates the Agreement, the Service Recipient shall demand payment, and the Service Provider shall pay a penalty of 40 (forty) per cent of the Creation Service price provided for in Clause 7.1 of the Agreement price, which upon the agreement of the Parties, is considered to be minimal, proper, fair and unquestionable (undisputed) losses of the Service Recipient.

<p><strong>VII. </strong><strong>FORCE MAJEURE CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Neither of the Parties is responsible for a full or partial failure to implement the obligations if they prove that the failure to implement the obligations was caused by Force Majeure circumstances, which could not be controlled or reasonably predicted at the time of entering into this Agreement and its circumstances or outcome could not be prevented.</li>
<li>A Party unable to implement its obligations due to Force Majeure circumstances must immediately inform the other Party in writing, indicating the circumstances that prevent it from implementing the obligations under this Agreement and the obligations that it will not be able to fulfil. In such case the implementation of the obligations is postponed until the said circumstances are eliminated. Should the other party not receive such message in 5 (five) calendar days, when the party, violating the Agreement, became aware or had to become aware of the said circumstance, then the latter must cover the loses, incurred due to failure to receive the said message.</li>
<li>The Force Majeure circumstances are established in accordance with the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania, hereinafter &ndash; the Civil Code, and the Regulations Regarding Exemption from Liability under Force Majeure Circumstances, adopted on 15 July 1996 by the Decision No. 840 of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania &ldquo;Regarding the approval of the regulations regarding the exemption from liability under Force Majeure circumstances&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The concept of Force Majeure does not include the circumstances that have influenced a Party&rsquo;s activity, which were considered by the Parties upon entering into this Agreement, i.e. circumstances and conditions that may occur in Lithuania and its economy, decisions of state and municipal institutions that caused a reorganisation, privatisation, liquidation, change of the type of business, suspension (hindering) of the business of any of the Parties, also other circumstances that should be regarded as special, but are likely to occur in Lithuania at the time of entering into the Agreement. The concept of Force Majeure also does not include the fact of no availability of the goods and services, needed for the implementation of the obligations, or that a Party does not have the necessary financial resources or that the Party&rsquo;s counterparty violate their obligations.</li>
<li>As soon as the Force Majeure circumstances are lifted, the Party, which could not implement its obligations due to the Force Majeure, must immediately notify the other Party and resume the implementation of its obligations. In cases, when the Force Majeure prevents a Party from implementing its obligations under this Agreement for more than 30 (thirty) calendar days, the other Party has a unilateral right to terminate the Agreement immediately by informing the other Party in writing.</li>
