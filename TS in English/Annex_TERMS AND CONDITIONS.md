<h1><a name="_Toc57967931"></a>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procurement object</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Contracting Authority intends to procure the services of modification and installation of the Central Public Procurement Information System - CVP IS (SAULĖ IS). Requirements for the object of the procurement are provided in Annex 1 to the Procurement Terms and Conditions "Technical Specification".</li>
<li>The procurement object shall not be divided into lots due to the reasons provided below:
<ul>
<li>The Office, specifying in detail the object to be procured, indicates in the procurement documents that in this case it is important to assess not only the price of the services for creation (modification) services of the object to be procured, but also all other costs related to the object to be procured, i.e. the price of warranty maintenance services, the price of SAULĖ IS maintenance / support services, the price of licenses required for SAULĖ IS production operation during the entire maintenance / support period and additional services related to SAULĖ IS changes and (or) implementation of requirements not specified in the Technical Specification for the whole SAULĖ IS life cycle over a period of 8 years. Assessment of services to this extent is aimed to ensure that the Contract performance becomes rationally measurable in terms of financial resources;</li>
<li>The different lots of the procurement object are technically very closely interconnected: the system source codes cannot be adjusted simultaneously by different Suppliers, as only one of these Suppliers would have and fulfil warranty obligations for a certain period of time, a similar situation arises with third party licenses - only licenses provided by the system author can ensure the proper operation of the installed system. The implementation of the Project, providing services by different Suppliers under separate contracts and for different periods, would be extremely technically complex in order to have a properly functioning final product and ensure its functionality not only during the Project but also after the end of the Project activities;</li>
<li>It is necessary for the Office to ensure the conditions for licenses for the entire duration of the Contract. During submission of initial tenders, solutions from different Suppliers with licenses from different Manufacturers will be able to compete, and the solutions will be implemented in different periods. Accordingly, it is necessary to ensure that the Supplier who has installed the Information System (using unique software licenses) cannot subsequently change the terms of the proposed licenses to the unfavourable for the Office, for example, apply an unreasonably high cost of license support;</li>
<li>This procurement also aims to acquire maintenance and support services for the created (modified) Information System. It is important to stress that after successful commissioning of the system, the Supplier will have to provide a warranty (36 months) for the Information System and any change to a third party product (new functionality, change of existing configuration) will void the Manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty. In order to avoid ambiguous situations where there is no clear boundary of responsibilities between different Suppliers and to maintain the guarantee provided by the Manufacturer, to ensure the provision of Information System maintenance and support services, it is planned to procure these services together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="_Toc57967932"></a>5.&nbsp; Means of communication and exchange of information between the Contracting Authority and Suppliers</h1>
<ul>
<li>Information on the members of the Procurement Commission who are authorized to maintain direct contact with the Suppliers and receive notices from them (other than intermediaries) related to procurement procedures is provided in Item 1 of Part I of the Notice.</li>

The Contracting Authority does not provide the Suppliers with a paper version of the procurement documents. The Suppliers should properly monitor the clarifications and supplements to the procurement documents published in CPP IS.</li>

<li>Assess whether the price offered by the Supplier is not abnormally low. If the tender price appears to be abnormally low (as specified in Annex 6 &ldquo;Tender Assessment Criteria and Conditions&rdquo; to the Procurement Terms and Conditions), the Contracting Authority applies to the Supplier using CPP IS correspondence means to justify the price of the procurement object or its components specified in the tender within a reasonable term;</li>
<li>The procurement executor shall contact the most economically advantageous Supplier for the submission of relevant documents confirming the information specified in the ESPD, if they have not been requested and evaluated at previous stages of the procurement procedure and (or) are not required by the procurement terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If, during the examination of the submitted tenders, the Contracting Authority finds that the Supplier has provided inaccurate, incomplete or false documents or data on compliance with the requirements of the procurement documents or these documents or data are missing, without prejudice to the principles of equality and transparency, it shall ask the Supplier to adjust, complete or clarify the documents or data within a reasonable term. Only documents or data on the lack of grounds for exclusion of the supplier, compliance with qualification requirements, quality management system and environmental protection management system standards, Supplier&rsquo;s authorization to sign an application or tender, joint activity agreements, security of tender validity and document and documents not related to the object of procurement, its technical characteristics, conditions of contract performance or tender price may be adjusted, completed, clarified and submitted new. Other documents or data of the Supplier&rsquo;s tender may be adjusted, completed and clarified, but no new documents or data may be submitted. It is not allowed to change the essence of the tender - to change the price or to make other changes that would make the non-compliant tender compliant with the requirements of the procurement documents during the adjustment, completion and clarification of these documents and data.</li>
<li>If the Contracting Authority finds errors in the calculation of the price indicated in the tender during the assessment of the tenders, it shall request the Suppliers to correct the arithmetical errors observed in the tender within the term specified by it without changing the price recorded during the inspection. When correcting arithmetical errors in the tender, the Supplier may correct the price components, but has no right to abandon the price components or supplement the price with new components.</li>
<li>The Contracting Authority may not evaluate the entire tender of the Supplier, if after examining its part it determines that, in accordance with the requirements of the procurement documents, the tender must be rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="_Toc57967950"></a>23.&nbsp; Grounds for rejection of tenders</h1>
<ul>
<li>A tender submitted by a Supplier shall be rejected if at least one of the following conditions is met:
<ul>
<li>the tender does not comply with the requirements set out in the procurement documents, including but not limited to cases where:
<ul>
<li>The Supplier does not comply with the conditions regarding the submission of alternative tenders or non-participation in the submission of several tenders as specified in Chapter 15 &ldquo;Requirements for Preparation and Submission of Tenders&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions;</li>
<li>The Supplier does not extend the validity of the tender and (or), if applicable, does not provide a security of the validity of the new tender;</li>
<li>The Supplier has encrypted a document stating the price of the tender and failed to provide a password (due to the circumstances) or provided an incorrect password, which prevented the Contracting Authority from decrypting the tender, prior to the commencement of the procedure (meeting);</li>
<li>The tender does not meet the other requirements set out in the procurement documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Supplier must be excluded in accordance with the provisions of these procurement documents on the grounds for exclusion, including in cases where the Supplier relies on the capacity of the economic operator or uses a subcontractor and they are subject to exclusion grounds in accordance with the procurement documents, but the situation of the economic operator or subcontractor complies with the established exclusion grounds and the supplier has not replaced this economic operator or subcontractor to an economic operator without exclusion grounds;</li>
<li>The Supplier does not meet the qualification requirement specified in the procurement documents and (or) the economic operator whose capacity is relied on by the supplier does not meet the qualification requirements and has not been replaced with an eligible economic operator meeting the requirements of the Contracting Authority, as well as if the Supplier does not meet other requirements specified in the procurement conditions;</li>
<li>If it is established that inaccurate, incomplete or false documents or data have been submitted or are missing, the Supplier has not adjusted, completed or clarified the information within the term set by the Contracting Authority, as specified in Chapter 22 &ldquo;Assessment of Tenders&rdquo;;</li>
<li>The price indicated in the tender is too high and unacceptable for the Contracting Authority. If the most economically advantageous tender is rejected on this basis, the other tenders may not be awarded and the procurement shall be terminated;</li>
<li>The tender price is abnormally low and the Supplier does not provide adequate evidence of the reasonableness of the lowest price offered;</li>
<li>The abnormally low tender does not comply with the environmental, social and labour law obligations referred to in item 2 of paragraph 2 of Article 17 of the LPP;</li>
<li>The tender offers an abnormally low price because the Supplier had received State aid, but the Supplier could not prove that the State aid had been granted lawfully within a reasonable period set by the Contracting Authority. If the Contracting Authority rejects the tender on this basis, it shall inform the European Commission thereof. State aid is any measure which fulfils the criteria laid down in Article 107 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;</li>
<li>The tender does not comply with the environmental, social and labour law obligations set out in European Union and national law, collective agreements and the international conventions listed in Annex 5 of the LPP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Supplier shall be informed in writing by CPP IS means about the rejection of the tender and the reasons for such rejection.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="_Toc57967951"></a>24.&nbsp; Ranking of tenders and determination of a successful tenderer</h1>
<ul>
<li>After examining, evaluating and comparing the submitted tenders, the Contracting Authority shall determine the ranking of tenders, which shall include the non-rejected tenders, and shall determine the successful tender and take a decision on the award of the Contract.</li>
<li>The raking of tenders is determined in the order of decreasing economic efficiency. If the economic efficiency of several submitted tenders is the same, the Supplier whose tender was submitted by means of CPP IS at the earliest shall be entered in higher position of the ranking of tenders.</li>
<li>Only 1 (one) most economically advantageous tender, which is in the first place in the ranking of tenders, will be able to be recognized as the successful tender.</li>
<li>If a tender has been submitted by only one supplier and its tender has not been rejected in accordance with the terms of these procurement documents or other tenders have been rejected during the procurement procedures, only one tender remains, the ranking of tenders shall not be determined and that tender shall be deemed successful.</li>
<li>If the price indicated in the most economically advantageous tender is abnormally high and unacceptable and the Contracting Authority has not indicated in the procurement documents which tender price it considers abnormally high and unacceptable, the first tender and other tenders in the ranking may not be determined and the procurement procedure shall be terminated. The price offered shall be considered excessive and unacceptable if it exceeds the funds allocated for the procurement by the Contracting Authority, established and recorded in the documents prepared by the Contracting Authority before the start of the procurement procedure and (or) in the procurement documents.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="_Toc57967952"></a>25.&nbsp; Informing on the results of the procurement procedures</h1>
<ul>
<li>If the Contracting Authority decides to award the Contract to the successful tenderer, the Suppliers, except in cases where Chapter 26 "Conclusion of the Contract" of the Procurement Terms and Conditions stipulates that the Contract shall be concluded orally, no later than by the term specified in Chapter 2 &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions, will be informed:

<li>A summary of the relevant information referred to in Clause 25.3 of the Procurement Terms and Conditions, which was not submitted during the procurement procedure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Contracting Authority decides not to award the Contract or to reopen the procurement, it shall inform the tenderers of the reasons for the decision not to award the Contract or to reopen the procurement.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of the tenderer&rsquo;s written request, the Contracting Authority shall provide this information in detail no later than within the term specified in Chapter 2 &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions:
<ul>
<li>to a Supplier whose tender has not been rejected - the characteristics of the successful tender and the relative advantages which led the tender to the success, as well as the names of the Supplier or contractors who submitted the tender;</li>
<li>to a Supplier whose tender has been rejected, &ndash; the reasons for the rejection of the tender, including, where applicable, information that the provisions of Article 55 (10) of the LPP have been followed and, in the cases referred to in Article 37 (6) and (7) of the LPP, the reasons for the equivalence decision or the services or works do not meet the specified description of results or functional requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the cases specified in this chapter of the procurement conditions, information shall not be provided if its disclosure is not consistent with the information and data protection legislation or the public interest, infringes the legitimate commercial interests of a particular Supplier or has an adverse effect on competition between Suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="_Toc57967953"></a>26.&nbsp; Award of the Contract</h1>
<ul>
<li>This procurement procedure is carried out in order to conclude a Contract with the Supplier, whose tender will be recognized as the successful in accordance with the procedure established in Chapter 22 of the Procurement Terms and Conditions &ldquo;Assessment of Tenders&rdquo;. The terms and conditions of the Contract are provided in Annex 7 &ldquo;Draft Contract&rdquo; to the Procurement Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li>The Contract shall be concluded immediately, but not earlier than the expiry of the standstill period specified in Chapter 2 &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions. The standstill period may be waived where there is only one interested party with whom the Contract will be awarded. Upon receipt of a copy of the Supplier&rsquo;s request or claim to the court, the Contracting Authority may not conclude the Contract until the standstill period specified in Chapter 2 &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; or Article 103 (2), Article 105 (2) (3) and Article 105 (3) (3) of the LPP and until the Contracting Authority has received the court notice of:
<ul>
<li>A reasoned court decision refusing to accept the action;</li>
<li>A reasoned court decision rejecting the Supplier&rsquo;s application for interim measures, when this application was received in court prior to the filing of the claim;</li>
<li>A court decision to grant the action without interim measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The successful tenderer shall be invited to conclude the Contract in writing and shall be informed of the time by which he must conclude the Contract.</li>
<li>The Supplier shall be deemed to have refused to conclude the Contract in at least one of the following cases:
<ul>
<li>The Supplier refuses to conclude it in writing;</li>
<li>The Supplier does not provide a document confirming the Contract performance security or other security, if such are specified in Chapter 18 &ldquo;Security of the Tender Validity&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions as necessary to be submitted before the effective date of the Contract;</li>
<li>The Supplier does not sign the Contract by the time specified by the Contracting Authority;</li>
<li>The Supplier refuses to enter into the Contract under the conditions specified in the LPP and procurement documents;</li>
<li>A group of suppliers whose tender is successful does not establish a legal entity as provided for in Chapter 14 &ldquo;Participation of a Group of Economic Entities&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the successful Supplier refuses to conclude the Contract, it shall be offered to the Supplier whose tender according to the established ranking of tenders is the first after the Supplier who has refused to conclude the Contract. Before proposing to award the Contract, the Contracting Authority shall ask that Supplier to provide relevant documents confirming the information provided in the ESPD, if these have not been requested and evaluated at earlier stages of the procurement procedure and (or) are not required by the procurement conditions and assess whether his tender should be rejected for other reasons.</li>
<li>The conclusion of the Contract does not increase the price of the successful supplier&rsquo;s tender and does not change other conditions. If the price in the tender is indicated in a currency other than the euro, the Contract shall specify the price converted into euros according to the indicative ratio of the euro to foreign currencies published by the European Central Bank and in cases where the reference rate is not published the euro / foreign exchange ratio on the day of submission of tenders. In case the Contracting Authority has to pay value added tax to the state budget for the acquired procurement object in accordance with the procedure established by the laws regulating taxes and their implementing legal acts, this tax included in the tender price shall be deducted upon conclusion of the Contract.</li>
<li>The Contracting Authority shall publish the successful tenderer&rsquo;s tender, the concluded contract and its amendments, except for information the disclosure of which would breach information and data protection legislation or public interest, would harm the legitimate commercial interests of the Supplier or adversely affect competition, in CPP IS no later than within 15 days after the conclusion or amendment of the Contract, but not later than before the initiation of the first payment under it.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="_Toc57967954"></a>27.&nbsp; Submission of claims and plaints and examination of claims</h1>
<ul>
<li>A Supplier who considers that the Contracting Authority has not complied with the requirements of the LPP, so infringed or will infringe its legitimate interests, to appeal the Contracting Authority&rsquo;s decisions or actions before the court, first in writing (by CPP IS correspondence or other electronic means or another suitable carrier) must submit a claim to the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li>The claim shall be examined in accordance with the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>The Contracting Authority must examine only those claims of the Suppliers which have been received before the date of conclusion of the Contract and submitted in accordance with the terms specified in Chapter 2 &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions;</li>
<li>The Contracting Authority may not consider claims submitted repeatedly due to the same decision or action taken by the Contracting Authority;</li>
<li>Upon receipt of the claim, the Contracting Authority shall immediately suspend the procurement procedure until the received claim has been examined and a decision has been made.</li>
<li>The Contracting Authority must examine the claim, make a reasoned decision and notify the Supplier who submitted the claim and the interested Suppliers in writing about the change of the previously announced terms of the procurement procedure no later than within the term specified in Chapter 2 &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; of the Procurement Terms and Conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Contracting Authority postpones the term for submission of tenders if the claims are not processed by expiry of the term for submission of tenders (if the claim is not examined - the term is not extended) or provide adjustments or clarifications of the procurement documents that significantly affect the preparation of tenders. If the tender is submitted immediately before the term for submission of tenders or submitted after the expiry of the term for submission of tenders and the Contracting Authority needs additional time to examine the claim, the Contracting Authority has the right to postpone the term for submission of tenders, if the tender examination procedure has not yet been finished.</li>
<li>The Supplier has the right to file an action for voidance of the Contract within 6 (six) months from the date of concluding the Contract.</li>
<li>The Supplier, having submitted a request or filed a claim in court, must submit a copy of the request or claim to the Contracting Authority with confirmation of receipt in court no later than within 3 (three) business days.</li>
<li>If the deadlines for procurement procedures previously notified to the Suppliers are extended due to the submission of the Supplier&rsquo;s request or filing an action with the court, the Contracting Authority shall send notices to the Suppliers and indicate the reasons for the extension.</li>
<li>The Contracting Authority, having become aware of the court decision on the Supplier&rsquo;s request or claim, shall inform the interested candidates and interested tenderers in writing about the court decisions within 3 (three) business days at the latest.</li>
