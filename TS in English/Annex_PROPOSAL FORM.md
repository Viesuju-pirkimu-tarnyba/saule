<li><strong>TENDER PRICE</strong>
<ul>
<li>The price in the tender shall be indicated in euros. If the prices in the tenders are indicated in foreign currency, they will have to be converted into euros according to the euro and foreign currency reference rate published by the European Central Bank, and in cases where the European Central Bank does not publish the euro and foreign currency reference rate, - according to the euro and foreign currency reference rate established and published by the Bank of Lithuania on the date of submission of tenders.</li>
<li>When calculating the price, the full scope and requirements of the procurement object, price components, etc. specified in the procurement documents must be considered. The contracting authority will have to be able to use the procurement object at the end of the contract without additional costs, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procurement documents. VAT is indicated separately. If the supplier is not a VAT payer, it must indicate this in the tender, indicating the legal basis. The supplier must assess whether it will become a VAT payer during the performance of the contract. If the supplier becomes a VAT payer during the performance of the contract, the tender must indicate the price including VAT. Tender prices will be assessed and compared with all taxes, including VAT. If the contracting authority has to pay VAT to the state budget for the acquired procurement object in accordance with the procedure established by the laws regulating taxes and their implementing legal acts, this tax is included in the tender price (if the supplier did not include it in the tender, the contracting authority shall include it for comparative purposes). The tender price must include all taxes and all other direct and indirect costs and fees incurred and (or) which may be incurred by the supplier in connection with the supply of the Goods, including but not limited to (unless the procurement documents clearly state that certain specific costs must not be included in the contract price):
<ul>
<li>all costs related to the preparation and submission of documents required by the Buyer;</li>
<li>the cost related to submission of the operation and maintenance manuals provided for in the Technical Specification;</li>
<li>costs for licenses, patents, permits, etc.</li>
<li>electronic invoicing costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the price indicated in the tender, expressed in figures, does not correspond to the price indicated in words, the price indicated in words shall be considered correct one.</li>
<li>All prices indicated in the tender (and their components) must be indicated to two decimal places. If the third number after the decimal point is from 0 to 4, the second number after the decimal point is left as it is, if the third number after the decimal point is from 5 to 9, we increase the second number after the decimal point by one unit, for example, 3.14159 rounded to the hundredth will be 3.14. Rounding 3.1153 to the hundredth will be 3.12.</li>
